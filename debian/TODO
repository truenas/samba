This is an incomplete list of a number of issues that need to be fixed.


TODOs before upload to unstable

- make a list of basic tests that should be done to ensure that the package is
  acceptable for unstable (and run these tests)

- investigate impact of changes to libraries to reverse dependencies and plan
  transitions (if there are any)
  - sssd
    fixed in git (#725992)
  - openchange
  - evolution-mapi

Other TODOs

- handle ad-dc stuff
  - have debconf question to configure ad dc
    - the packaging from the old samba4/samba-ad-dc packages can help there
  - convert the users to the new db, or document that this doesn't happen
	automatically

- what is the status of the docs?

  - documentation2.patch is upstream
  - The former documentation.patch needs to be rewritten against the xml input

- Add script to verify that headers are usable through current dependencies
  (to prevent bugs like #525888)
