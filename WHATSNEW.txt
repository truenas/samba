                   Release Notes for Samba 4.17.4
                         December 15, 2022
                   ==============================


This is the latest stable release of the Samba 4.17 release series.
It also contains security changes in order to address the following defects:


o CVE-2022-37966: This is the Samba CVE for the Windows Kerberos
                  RC4-HMAC Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
                  disclosed by Microsoft on Nov 8 2022.

                  A Samba Active Directory DC will issue weak rc4-hmac
                  session keys for use between modern clients and servers
                  despite all modern Kerberos implementations supporting
                  the aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 cipher.

                  On Samba Active Directory DCs and members
                  'kerberos encryption types = legacy' would force
                  rc4-hmac as a client even if the server supports
                  aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and/or aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96.

                  https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-37966.html

o CVE-2022-37967: This is the Samba CVE for the Windows
                  Kerberos Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
                  disclosed by Microsoft on Nov 8 2022.

                  A service account with the special constrained
                  delegation permission could forge a more powerful
                  ticket than the one it was presented with.

                  https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-37967.html

o CVE-2022-38023: The "RC4" protection of the NetLogon Secure channel uses the
                  same algorithms as rc4-hmac cryptography in Kerberos,
                  and so must also be assumed to be weak.

                  https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-38023.html

Note that there are several important behavior changes
included in this release, which may cause compatibility problems
interacting with system still expecting the former behavior.
Please read the advisories of CVE-2022-37966,
CVE-2022-37967 and CVE-2022-38023 carefully!

samba-tool got a new 'domain trust modify' subcommand
-----------------------------------------------------

This allows "msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes" to be changed
on trustedDomain objects. Even against remote DCs (including Windows)
using the --local-dc-ipaddress= (and other --local-dc-* options).
See 'samba-tool domain trust modify --help' for further details.

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.17.0
                         September 13, 2022
                   ==============================


This is the first stable release of the Samba 4.17 release series.
Please read the release notes carefully before upgrading.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

SMB Server performance improvements
-----------------------------------

The security improvements in recent releases
(4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16), mainly as protection against symlink races,
caused performance regressions for meta data heavy workloads.

With 4.17 the situation improved a lot again:

- Pathnames given by a client are devided into dirname and basename.
  The amount of syscalls to validate dirnames is reduced to 2 syscalls
  (openat, close) per component. On modern Linux kernels (>= 5.6) smbd
  makes use of the openat2() syscall with RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS,
  in order to just use 2 syscalls (openat2, close) for the whole dirname.

- Contended path based operations used to generate a lot of unsolicited
  wakeup events causing thundering herd problems, which lead to masive
  latencies for some clients. These events are now avoided in order
  to provide stable latencies and much higher throughput of open/close
  operations.

Configure without the SMB1 Server
---------------------------------

It is now possible to configure Samba without support for
the SMB1 protocol in smbd. This can be selected at configure
time with either of the options:

--with-smb1-server
--without-smb1-server

By default (without either of these options set) Samba
is configured to include SMB1 support (i.e. --with-smb1-server
is the default). When Samba is configured without SMB1 support,
none of the SMB1 code is included inside smbd except the minimal
stub code needed to allow a client to connect as SMB1 and immediately
negotiate the selected protocol into SMB2 (as a Windows server also
allows).

None of the SMB1-only smb.conf parameters are removed when
configured without SMB1, but these parameters are ignored by
the smbd server. This allows deployment without having to change
an existing smb.conf file.

This option allows sites, OEMs and integrators to configure Samba
to remove the old and insecure SMB1 protocol from their products.

Note that the Samba client libraries still support SMB1 connections
even when Samba is configured as --without-smb1-server. This is
to ensure maximum compatibility with environments containing old
SMB1 servers.

Bronze bit and S4U support now also with MIT Kerberos 1.20
----------------------------------------------------------

In 2020 Microsoft Security Response Team received another Kerberos-related
report. Eventually, that led to a security update of the CVE-2020-17049,
Kerberos KDC Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability, also known as a ‘Bronze
Bit’. With this vulnerability, a compromised service that is configured to use
Kerberos constrained delegation feature could tamper with a service ticket that
is not valid for delegation to force the KDC to accept it.

With the release of MIT Kerberos 1.20, Samba AD DC is able able to mitigate the
‘Bronze Bit’ attack. MIT Kerberos KDC's KDB (Kerberos Database Driver) API was
changed to allow passing more details between KDC and KDB components. When built
against MIT Kerberos, Samba AD DC supports MIT Kerberos 1.19 and 1.20 versions
but 'Bronze Bit' mitigation is provided only with MIT Kerberos 1.20.

In addition to fixing the ‘Bronze Bit’ issue, Samba AD DC now fully supports
S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy Kerberos extensions.

Note the default (Heimdal-based) KDC was already fixed in 2021,
see https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14642

Resource Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) support
----------------------------------------------------

Samba AD DC built with MIT Kerberos 1.20 offers RBCD support now. With MIT
Kerberos 1.20 we have complete RBCD support passing Sambas S4U testsuite.

samba-tool delegation got the 'add-principal' and 'del-principal' subcommands
in order to manage RBCD.

To complete RBCD support and make it useful to Administrators we added the
Asserted Identity [1] SID into the PAC for constrained delegation. This is
available for Samba AD compiled with MIT Kerberos 1.20.

Note the default (Heimdal-based) KDC does not support RBCD yet.

[1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-constrained-delegation-overview

Customizable DNS listening port
-------------------------------

It is now possible to set a custom listening port for the builtin DNS service,
making easy to host another DNS on the same system that would bind to the
default port and forward the domain-specific queries to Samba using the custom
port. This is the opposite configuration of setting a forwarder in Samba.

It makes possible to use another DNS server as a front and forward to Samba.

Dynamic DNS updates may not be proxied by the front DNS server when forwarding
to Samba. Dynamic DNS update proxying depends on the features of the other DNS
server used as a front.

CTDB changes
------------

* When Samba is configured with both --with-cluster-support and
  --systemd-install-services then a systemd service file for CTDB will
  be installed.

* ctdbd_wrapper has been removed.  ctdbd is now started directly from
  a systemd service file or init script.

* The syntax for the ctdb.tunables configuration file has been
  relaxed.  However, trailing garbage after the value, including
  comments, is no longer permitted.  Please see ctdb-tunables(7) for
  more details.

Operation without the (unsalted) NT password hash
-------------------------------------------------

When Samba is configured with 'nt hash store = never' then Samba will
no longer store the (unsalted) NT password hash for users in Active
Directory.  (Trust accounts, like computers, domain controllers and
inter-domain trusts are not impacted).

In the next version of Samba the default for 'nt hash store' will
change from 'always' to 'auto', where it will follow (behave as 'nt
hash store = never' when 'ntlm auth = disabled' is set.

Security-focused deployments of Samba that have eliminated NTLM from
their networks will find setting 'ntlm auth = disabled' with 'nt hash
store = always' as a useful way to improve compliance with
best-practice guidance on password storage (which is to always use an
interated hash).

Note that when 'nt hash store = never' is set, then arcfour-hmac-md5
Kerberos keys will not be available for users who subsequently change
their password, as these keys derive their values from NT hashes.  AES
keys are stored by default for all deployments of Samba with Domain
Functional Level 2008 or later, are supported by all modern clients,
and are much more secure.

Finally, also note that password history in Active Directory is stored
in nTPwdHistory using a series of NT hash values.  Therefore the full
password history feature is not available in this mode.

To provide some protection against password re-use previous Kerberos
hash values (the current, old and older values are already stored) are
used, providing a history length of 3.

There is one small limitation of this workaround: Changing the
sAMAccountName, userAccountControl or userPrincipalName of an account
can cause the Kerberos password salt to change.  This means that after
*both* an account rename and a password change, only the current
password will be recognised for password history purposes.

Python API for smbconf
----------------------

Samba's smbconf library provides a generic frontend to various
configuration backends (plain text file, registry) as a C library. A
new Python wrapper, importable as 'samba.smbconf' is available.  An
additional module, 'samba.samba3.smbconf', is also available to enable
registry backend support. These libraries allow Python programs to
read, and optionally write, Samba configuration natively.

JSON support for smbstatus
--------------------------

It is now possible to print detailed information in JSON format in
the smbstatus program using the new option --json. The JSON output
covers all the existing text output including sessions, connections,
open files, byte-range locks, notifies and profile data with all
low-level information maintained by Samba in the respective databases.

Protected Users security group
------------------------------

Samba AD DC now includes support for the Protected Users security
group introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2. The feature reduces the
attack surface of user accounts by preventing the use of weak
encryption types. It also mitigates the effects of credential theft by
limiting credential lifetime and scope.

The protections are intended for user accounts only, and service or
computer accounts should not be added to the Protected Users
group. User accounts added to the group are granted the following
security protections:

   * NTLM authentication is disabled.
   * Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) encrypted with RC4 are
     not issued to or accepted from affected principals. Tickets
     encrypted with AES, and service tickets encrypted with RC4, are
     not affected by this restriction.
   * The lifetime of Kerberos TGTs is restricted to a maximum of four
     hours.
   * Kerberos constrained and unconstrained delegation is disabled.

If the Protected Users group is not already present in the domain, it
can be created with 'samba-tool group add'. The new '--special'
parameter must be specified, with 'Protected Users' as the name of the
group. An example command invocation is:

samba-tool group add 'Protected Users' --special

or against a remote server:

samba-tool group add 'Protected Users' --special -H ldap://dc1.example.com -U Administrator

The Protected Users group is identified in the domain by its having a
RID of 525. Thus, it should only be created with samba-tool and the
'--special' parameter, as above, so that it has the required RID
to function correctly.
